The data set summary is quoted below. Let’s have a quick read. . .

"A computer vision system was developed to distinguish seven different registered varieties of dry beans with
similar features in order to obtain uniform seed classification. For the classification model, images of 13,611
grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. Bean images obtained by
the computer vision system were subjected to segmentation and feature extraction stages, and a total of 16
features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.”

This goal of this project is to use the knowledge I have gained during HarvardX’s Data Science Professional
Certificate program to compose several multi-class classification algorithms in an attempt to match or beat
the accuracy reported by Koklu and Oskan in their paper titled “Multiclass Classification of Dry Beans Using
Computer Vision and Machine Learning Techniques”. They used a support vector machine to achieve a
93.13% accuracy rate. You can read the abstract of their paper online at ScienceDirect.com by following this

I have only read the abstract and not the paper itself in order to preserve my own creative responses in
solving this multi-class classification problem. I hope you enjoy reading this project
